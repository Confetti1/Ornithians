TO DO:
Race Details: Live about as long as humans.
  -Weaker bones, so slightly less health. Their light bones gives them superior movement speed. 
  -Procreate via eggs. (try to make it so they get sad if you eat fertilized ones)
Custom head and body graphics
-Custom hair, plumage that fits right into head (unless male, perhaps has more colorful plumage?)
-Add cheek body parts so that some different colors can be present on the face. 
-Add beak body part on top of cheeks to prevent overlap
-Add eyes as individual body parts so they can have different colors, plus make them disappear if character is missing an eye.
Custom body setup
-Beak, tail feathers
New social interactions
-Preening?
Backstory ideas
-Woodpecker: Good with plants

New nutrient sources
-Seeds, perhaps millet farm? Maybe have it similar to chocolate, but only Ornithians enjoy it. 

Possible Ornithian subspecies:
  -Corvians: Raven-themed folks who have no qualms with eating rotten corpses.
