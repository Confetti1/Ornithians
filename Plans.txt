TO DO:
- Add custom bird ears that are inside the head
Race Details: Live about as long as humans.
  -!Weaker bones, so slightly less health. Their light bones gives them superior movement speed. 
  -!Procreate via eggs. (try to make it so they get sad if you eat fertilized ones) Make sure that it takes a long time for eggs to be produced.
  -!Mature quickly (A few years) in order to get children to adults fast.
  -!Talons and beak do poke damage
  -!Generally do better in hot environments than average, and do pretty normal in cold ones. 
  -Detail their societal structure, figure out backstories based on it. 
Custom head and body graphics
  -Custom hair, plumage that fits right into head (unless male, perhaps has more colorful plumage?)
  -!Add cheek body part so that some different colors can be present on the face. 
  -!Add beak body part on top of cheeks to prevent overlap
  -!Add eyes as individual body parts so they can have different colors, plus make them disappear if character is missing an eye.
Custom body setup
  -!Beak, tail feathers, !talons
New social interactions
  -Preening?
Backstory ideas (Have multiple backstories for each bird type so that there's some good options, these are just what the base beak types give)
  -Woodpecker: Good with plantcutting
  -Owl: Obviously has night-owl trait, good shooting for night hunting.
  -Parrot: Higher social and crafting. Perhaps higher intellectual.
  -Nester: Cooking and Medical
  -Separate backstories for refugees and/or starting colonists. 
  


Possible Ornithian subspecies:
  -Corvians: Raven-themed folks who have no qualms with eating rotten corpses. Higher social and intellectual. (OR make the rotten food eating a trait, and force it for Corvid beak type!!)

Other Animals
  -Some kind of pack beast that they use, perhaps a giant bird or some other big creature. Add backstories for those who grew up caring for them. Kneaderpillar.
  
Other Things:  
  
New nutrient sources
  -Seeds, perhaps millet farm? Maybe have it similar to chocolate, but only Ornithians enjoy it. 
  -Flowers are edible for them

New building material/wall types
  -Woven sticks, quick to build but are very weak.
  -Featherwoven sticks, adds ambient heat in the area as it helps keep an area warm.
  -Nesttraps, interwoven sticks that jut out of the ground. Makes an area where pawns move much slower through. 
  -Seed Oven (maybe) for cooking delicious seed treats
  -Nestbed, a bed treated with comforting feathers and healing herbs. (Similar to hospital bed, not quite as effective)
  -Component Builder? A more simple place to fabricate components, takes significantly longer. 
  
New Weapons/Equipment
  -Feathergun: Gun that does minimal damage, but has very fast rate of fire. 


Clan Lore:
Nesters: Ones who take care of the eggs and the hatchlings. They are typically females, but sometimes males take the role.
StargazerS: Those who study the stars and gain inspiration from them. They invent unique things under the guidance of their ancestors in the sky. 
Featherguard: those tasked with protecting the clan.
Herbfeathers: Those in charge of keeping people of the clan healthy and strong.
