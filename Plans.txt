TO DO:
Race Details: Live about as long as humans.
  -Weaker bones, so slightly less health. Their light bones gives them superior movement speed. 
  -Procreate via eggs. (try to make it so they get sad if you eat fertilized ones) Make sure that it takes a long time for eggs to be produced.
Custom head and body graphics
  -Custom hair, plumage that fits right into head (unless male, perhaps has more colorful plumage?)
  -Add cheek body part so that some different colors can be present on the face. 
  -Add beak body part on top of cheeks to prevent overlap
  -Add eyes as individual body parts so they can have different colors, plus make them disappear if character is missing an eye.
Custom body setup
  -Beak, tail feathers
New social interactions
  -Preening?
Backstory ideas (Have multiple backstories for each bird type so that there's some good options, these are just what the base beak types give)
  -Woodpecker: Good with plantcutting
  -Owl: Obviously has night-owl trait, good shooting for night hunting.
  -Parrot: Higher social and crafting. Perhaps higher intellectual.


New nutrient sources
-Seeds, perhaps millet farm? Maybe have it similar to chocolate, but only Ornithians enjoy it. 

Possible Ornithian subspecies:
  -Corvians: Raven-themed folks who have no qualms with eating rotten corpses. Higher social and intellectual.
